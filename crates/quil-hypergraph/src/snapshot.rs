//! Snapshot manager — port of `hypergraph/snapshot_manager.go`.
//!
//! Tracks recent published roots so sync clients can request data
//! against a specific historical commitment. The Go version pairs
//! each generation with a Pebble DB snapshot (point-in-time consistent
//! reads); this Rust port keeps the (root, frame_number) registry and
//! optionally pairs each generation with a `SnapshotReadable` —
//! a frozen-bytes copy of all tree blobs at publish time, captured
//! via `HypergraphStore::capture_tree_snapshot`. With a bound
//! snapshot, sync clients reading via the handle see only the
//! state at publish time, immune to concurrent writes through the
//! live store.
//!
//! Behavioural parity with Go:
//!
//! - `publish(root, frame)` adds a new generation. Duplicate roots
//! are no-ops (matches Go's "same root → no change").
//! - `publish_with_snapshot(root, frame, snap)` is the same but
//! binds an opaque DB-snapshot reference to the generation, which
//! `acquire` returns to the caller for point-in-time reads.
//! - `acquire(expected_root)` returns the matching generation handle
//! or `None` if the requested root is unknown. With no
//! `expected_root`, returns the latest generation.
//! - Up to `MAX_GENERATIONS` retained — older entries evicted FIFO.
//! Evicted generations drop their snapshot Arc, releasing the
//! underlying frozen bytes.
//! - Closed managers reject all subsequent operations.

/// Maximum number of historical snapshot generations retained.
///
/// Go uses `maxSnapshotGenerations = 10`, but with publishing roughly
/// once per frame that's only ~10 frames of retention. A follower whose
/// prover-tree sync runs on a multi-minute cadence (tens of frames apart)
/// then requests a root the archive has already evicted, gets
/// `failed to acquire snapshot`, and falls back to a perpetually-lagging
/// incremental sync — leaving its registry stale and the node stuck in
/// degraded-coverage prover-only mode. Widened to
/// 64 (~64 frames ≈ ~10 min at 10s/frame) so a follower a sync-cycle or
/// two behind can still acquire the snapshot for a clean full resync.
///
/// Widened again to 128 (~128 frames ≈ ~21 min at 10s/frame) to support the
/// far-behind archive STATE-JUMP: that recovery syncs the prover tree PLUS
/// every app-shard tree (× 4 phases) — all pinned to a SINGLE target frame's
/// snapshot generation for cross-tree consistency — which is a sequential,
/// multi-minute operation. The target generation must survive on the SERVING
/// archive for the whole jump, so retention has to comfortably exceed the jump
/// duration (a mismatch would evict the generation mid-jump → `failed to
/// acquire snapshot`, aborting the jump). 128 leaves ample headroom over a
/// realistic sequential jump (mostly-small shards + one QUIL shard).
///
/// Each generation now binds a REAL RocksDB point-in-time snapshot (see
/// `RocksHypergraphSnapshot`), which pins the superseded key versions it
/// covers until released. Release is driven by `Drop`: a generation
/// evicted past this cap (FIFO `pop_back`) or cleared on `close()` drops
/// its handle and releases the snapshot — unless an in-flight sync
/// session still holds an `Arc` clone, in which case release waits for
/// that session to finish. So this count bounds disk-version retention;
/// raising it widens the catch-up window at the cost of pinning more
/// versions on a busy archive.
///
/// Widened to TWO FULL EPOCHS (2 × `EPOCH_LENGTH_FRAMES` = 1440 frames ≈ ~4h at
/// 10s/frame) to CLOSE THE STATE-JUMP DEAD ZONE. At 128 a node lagging 128–1000
/// frames could neither incrementally sync — its target prover-tree version was
/// already pruned past this cap, so `resolve_root` returns a `(version, frame)`
/// from the persistent index whose tree DATA is gone → the pulled tree hashes to
/// a different root → `phase root != anchor` forever — nor state-jump, since the
/// gap was below `state_jump_min_gap` (1000). The prover tree churns EVERY frame
/// now, so historical roots don't otherwise persist. Making retention (1440) >
/// the state-jump threshold (1000) guarantees a node anywhere below the jump
/// trigger still finds its target retained, so it can always incrementally
