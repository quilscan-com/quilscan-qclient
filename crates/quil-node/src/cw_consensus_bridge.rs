//! Node-side wiring for the commonware-simplex global consensus (P2c),
//! **additive + gated**: it runs only when `config.engine.consensus_committee`
//! is non-empty and does NOT replace the existing quil-consensus path (removing
//! that + this gate is the localnet-validated cutover step). It bridges the
//! simplex engine's channels to the existing `:8340` transport:
//!
//! - outbound: [`Cw8340Transport`] (`GlobalConsensusTransport`) tags each
//! simplex message with its channel and fans it out via the existing
//! `DirectGlobalConsensusPublisher`;
//! - inbound: [`CwInboundRouter`] demuxes a `:8340` message (by its channel
//! bitmask) into the engine's matching inbound channel, resolving the sender
//! to its committee Falcon key.
//!
//! These types compile and are ready to invoke; the two remaining wires — the
//! `start_cw_global_consensus` call at the activation site and a `route(...)`
//! arm in the receive loop — flip the path on and are applied in the
//! localnet-validated cutover (they modify the live receive loop, so they are
//! not enabled here).
