//! App shard consensus engine: runs HotStuff/BFT consensus for a single
//! application shard, producing and validating AppShardFrames.
//!
//! Each worker thread creates one of these when assigned a filter via
//! the `Respawn` command. The engine:
//! 1. Spawns a HotStuff event loop with per-shard committee/voting/leader
//! 2. Processes inbound messages through validation → routing → handlers
//! 3. Collects messages for frame production via the leader provider
//! 4. Handles consensus events (finalization, equivocation, rank changes)

/// token / compute / hypergraph engines for a shard: each bundle is
/// dispatched by address to its intrinsic engine, which applies its
/// state changes (token spends + spent-markers, compute outputs,
/// hyperedge mutations) into the per-shard CRDT.
///
/// Per bundle, in `frame.requests` slice order (Go fans these out over
/// an errgroup but relies on CRDT commutativity for determinism; a
/// serial loop in the same order is deterministic and a safe superset):
/// 1. canonical-encode the bundle,
/// 2. cost basis → baseline fee (`GetBaselineFee/cost`, or 0 when the
/// bundle has zero cost),
/// 3. `fee = baseline * fee_multiplier_vote` — the app-shard path
/// multiplies by the header's vote; the global path does not
/// (app_consensus_engine.go:1515 vs frame_materializer.go:217),
/// 4. `process_message(frame, fee, app_address[..32], bytes)` —
/// address is the shard's own app address (NOT the global
/// 0xFF*32), which routes dispatch to the right engine.
///
/// BEST-EFFORT per bundle: a bundle that fails to encode or dispatch is
/// SKIPPED (logged), not fatal — mirroring the Rust global materializer
/// (`frame_materializer.rs`), and deliberately NOT Go's app-side
/// fail-fast. Blocking the frame on a single bad bundle would let one
/// malformed/unroutable request permanently stall a shard's clock chain
/// (the caller seals regardless of this result). The only hard error is
/// a `commit_frame` failure. No `validate_message` is run: app-shard
/// validity/signature gating happens upstream at message ingest, and the
/// per-tx crypto/double-spend checks live inside the engines'
/// `process_message`. Engines self-commit their changeset per message
/// (the Rust model — see the token engine's `commit_state`);
/// `commit_frame` then flushes the CRDT phase trees to the backing store.
///
/// Returns `(processed, skipped)`.
/// The network world-state size certified by global consensus on global frame
/// `global_frame_number` (the frame an app-shard frame is anchored to). Frame 0
/// (no anchor: genesis / pre-chain tests) prices at size zero. A missing anchor
/// frame is an infrastructure fault: the frame must be retried, never priced
/// from a substitute, or replicas could disagree on whether a fee suffices.
/// Voter checks of a proposal against the state it declares as its pre-state:
/// the body root, `state_roots`, the previous frame's fee total and the relay
