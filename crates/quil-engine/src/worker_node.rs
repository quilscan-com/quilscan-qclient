//! Worker-only node — runs on a separate machine and connects back
//! to the master via gRPC for shard consensus.
//!
//! Usage: `quil-node --core=N --config /path/to/config`
//!
//! The worker:
//! 1. Starts a gRPC server (DataIPCService) for master commands
//! 2. Connects to master's gRPC endpoint for message streaming
//! 3. Runs AppConsensusEngine when assigned a shard via Respawn
//! 4. Monitors parent process and exits if master dies
