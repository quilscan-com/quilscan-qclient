//! Archive-side ingest of full app-shard frames.
//!
//! Archives don't run an `AppConsensusEngine`, but they bulk-subscribe to
//! all shard traffic (`[0xFF;32]`) and must materialize every shard's
//! state so they can serve it via HyperSync. This receives the full
//! `AppShardFrame`s published on `shard_frame_bitmask`, verifies them, and
//! materializes them — in strict frame order per shard — into the
//! archive's (global) hypergraph CRDT via its existing
//! `ExecutionEngineManager`.
//!
//! Verification (no consensus participation required):
//!   1. The header's quorum aggregate BLS cert is checked against the
//!      shard committee (active provers under the frame's address) via
//!      `BlsAppFrameValidator` — same check the consensus path uses. This
//!      proves the header (and its `requests_root`) was finalized by the
//!      shard's quorum.
//!   2. The carried `requests` are recomputed to a `requests_root` and
//!      required to equal the signed one — defends against a relay
//!      swapping requests under an otherwise-valid header.
//!
//! A frame that passes, and is admitted (certified, or linked to by a
//! certified frame), is also stored in the archive's clock store, from which
//! it serves shard frames to peers.
