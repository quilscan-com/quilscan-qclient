# Shard operations: arithmetic and sequence testing

Shard policy spans reward ranking, lifecycle decisions, authenticated execution,
registry observation and worker reconciliation. Isolated decision tests remain
useful, but cannot establish correctness of these interactions over time.

## Shared reward arithmetic

`quil_execution::pricing::allocation_ring_reward` defines allocation arithmetic.
It retains issuance's 53-bit square-root precision, fused division, final
truncation and legacy ring clamp. Issuance consumes the ring amount;
`allocation_prover_reward` divides that amount among eight prover slots.
The proposer and shard RPC estimates use the latter. qclient consumes the RPC
estimate and independently formats it and applies its projected-total policy.

Callers still select inputs: a holding uses its confirmed ring, whereas a
prospective join uses the predicted ring, including contention policy. Different
inputs can correctly yield different estimates. Metadata freshness and worker
eligibility are not arithmetic concerns. Do not turn a projected reward into an
authenticated entitlement or alter consensus validation to match a projection.

Characterization retains the previous issuance calculation as an independent
oracle. Fixed vectors include non-square counts and a rounding boundary that
failed under the previous proposer implementation. API parity tests complement,
rather than replace, those independent expectations.

## Deterministic scenario suite

`src/provers/lifecycle_scenarios.rs` runs the real evaluator and allocator against
controlled registry/worker observations. It records event traces and verifies
unique bindings after every tick. Its coverage includes:

| History or matrix | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| Join → confirm → deferred activation → renewal → leave notice → departure | Boundary timing, retained bindings and eventual release, with restart |
| Rejected leave → delayed/successful/failed renewal | Retain or rebind through one rejection epoch; no orphan leave during recovery; bounded failure cleanup |
| Delayed join observation before/after worker timeout | Timeout does not prove rejection; late observations restore a worker |
| Small allocation-state/worker matrix | Joining, Active, Paused, Leaving, Rejected and Kicked; storage epochs; idle/bound and manual/automatic workers; boundary neighbors |
| Replacement submission → observation → confirmation → departure | No extra leave wave funds the same demand; capacity becomes joinable after notice |
| 64 fixed-seed recovery histories | Varied frame increments, observation delays and restarts; independent binding expectations and replayable traces |

Run in the project Docker image:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p quil-execution --lib pricing:: -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p quil-engine --lib reward -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p quil-engine --lib provers:: -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p quil-engine --lib worker_allocator:: -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p quil-engine --test e2e_epoch_confirm -- --test-threads=1
```

The scenario registry is an observation boundary, not an implementation of
signature verification or execution. Signed encoding, materialization and
store-backed registry behavior remain covered by the execution and existing
end-to-end suites. A restart recreates policy state, not the entire distributed
network. The suite does not claim to enumerate every possible execution.

## Per-shard lifecycle plans

The evaluator compiles policy candidates into one frame-scoped intent per
filter before dispatch. Capacity-driven join rejection overrides score-driven
confirmation; departure and leave rejection defer renewal until registry
observation establishes retention. Duplicate actions are removed without
reordering ranked batches or separating join filters from worker IDs.
Incompatible intents, mixed frames and conflicting join worker assignments
reject the whole evaluation before publication and emit a warning.

The production shared registry captures owner allocations, summaries and the
Active/Leaving address census under one read lock. Planning uses that captured
view rather than reading membership again later. Compatibility registries keep
sequential getter semantics and must override the capture API if they support
concurrent mutation. Workers are captured separately; this is not an atomic
snapshot spanning the registry and worker manager. Evaluation and accepted-plan
cooldown commitment are serialized across poller/gossip callers. A rejected
plan consumes no proposal cooldown; selected joins are explicitly excluded from
replacement demand before retry bookkeeping is committed.

The plan compiler tests every ordered pair of action kinds, mixed-shard
batches and duplicate worker assignments. Existing evaluator and sequence tests
exercise its integration with real policy decisions. This does not provide an
globally atomic registry/worker snapshot or persisted leaving-to-joining
replacement pairs. Those remain necessary follow-ups before claiming a complete
distributed lifecycle planner.

The pipeline reserves filters before spawning joins, leaves and rejections;
confirmations use the same owner while preparing storage. A running operation
blocks another operation kind on that filter, including across epoch boundaries.
Unrelated filters can progress. Successful publication keeps the existing
bounded retry fence within the epoch, but is not a registry acknowledgement.
For chunked joins, later failure releases only unpublished filters. Encoder
ownership remains inside the blocking task when its async waiter is cancelled.
This does not persist submission ownership or reserve replacement workers across
restart; those need the explicit replacement state machine.

## Further coverage

Extend the harness with observed counterexamples and independent expectations.
Add multiple-node contention histories, split/merge and committee handoff
sequences, loss/reordering of signed messages, and independently lagging registry
views. Couple those histories to real signed materialization where practical;
keep fast policy tests separate from expensive cryptographic integration tests.
Replace process-global test epoch settings with instance-scoped configuration
before introducing concurrently simulated networks with different epoch lengths.
Counterfactual controls must fail when an important guard is removed. Preserve
release optimization settings and never relax authentication to make a test pass.

### Leave decision stability

Accepted automatic leave rejections remain attached to the exact leave request
through its decision epoch. Archive metadata changes cannot convert that request
into a confirmation. The node restores this local decision journal before
lifecycle dispatch; failed writes or WAL sync prevent plan commitment. A new
leave request or decision epoch has its own decision. Protocol eligibility and
notice timing remain authoritative.

Score confirmations consume available destinations one-to-one, worst holding
first. Coverage swaps subtract workers already serving confirmed departures and
score confirmations selected in the current plan. These are capacity bounds,
not persisted source-to-destination worker reservations; #686 retains that
broader scope. Confirmation logs report policy cause counts without metric
labels containing shard filters.
